## 🧑‍💻 About Me

🔥 I'm an ambitious and deeply passionate individual driven by the transformative power of technology — especially in the domains of *Artificial Intelligence* and *Machine Learning*.

💡 I believe that code is more than syntax; it's a tool to *solve real-world problems*, *automate workflows*, and *build solutions that matter*.

🐍 Currently diving deep into **Python**, sharpening my scripting, automation, and integration skills through hands-on projects.

🌐 Enthusiastic about learning **web development**, **RESTful APIs**, and emerging areas like **Agentic AI**.

🚀 A *relentless learner* with an eye for detail, love for structure, and hunger for knowledge. Whether in solo builds or team efforts, I bring curiosity, collaboration, and consistency to the table.
